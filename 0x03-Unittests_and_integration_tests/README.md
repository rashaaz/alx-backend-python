# Unit Tests and Integration Tests

## Project Overview
This project focuses on creating and running unit tests and integration tests for a Python application. The aim is to ensure that each function in your code works correctly in isolation and that all parts of your application work together as expected.

## Project Timeline
- **Project Start:** Jun 27, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Project End:** Jul 2, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Checker Release:** Jun 28, 2024, 12:00 PM
- **Auto Review:** Launched at the deadline

## Unit Testing
Unit testing is the process of testing individual functions to ensure they return expected results for a given set of inputs. Unit tests should cover both standard inputs and edge cases, and should only test the logic within the function being tested. Calls to other functions, especially those involving network or database access, should be mocked.

### Execution
To execute your unit tests, use the following command:
```sh
$ python -m unittest path/to/test_file.py
