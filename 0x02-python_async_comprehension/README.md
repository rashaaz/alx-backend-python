# 0x02. Python - Async Comprehension

## Project Overview

This project focuses on asynchronous programming in Python, specifically using asynchronous comprehensions and generators. By the end of this project, you should be able to write asynchronous generators, use async comprehensions, and properly type-annotate generators.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will learn:
- How to write an asynchronous generator.
- How to use async comprehensions.
- How to type-annotate generators.

## Requirements

- **Editor**: vi, vim, emacs
- **Python version**: Python 3.7
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- **Code Style**: pycodestyle (version 2.5.x)
- All files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all your files should be `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project directory is mandatory.
- All modules and functions must have documentation.
- All functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
